# Client Context Rule

ALWAYS ask the user which client the changes are intended for before making ANY code edits:
- **FerragemMV** (The other folder: `GerenteDeEstoque`)
- **RolaMais** (This folder: `GerenteDeEstoqueRL`)
- **Both** (Apply changes to both)

If the user is in `GerenteDeEstoque`, the context is FerragemMV, but you must still confirm if the change should also apply to RolaMais (and vice versa).

NEVER assume a change applies to only one unless explicitly told.
