# Client Context Rule

ALWAYS ask the user which client the changes are intended for before making ANY code edits:
- **FerragemMV** (This folder: `GerenteDeEstoque`)
- **RolaMais** (The other folder: `GerenteDeEstoqueRL`)
- **Both** (Apply changes to both)

If the user is in `GerenteDeEstoqueRL`, the context is RolaMais, but you must still confirm if the change should also apply to FerragemMV (and vice versa).

NEVER assume a change applies to only one unless explicitly told.
